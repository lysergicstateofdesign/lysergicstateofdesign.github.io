== I Am Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This website is currently hosted on GitHub. This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system nor is it Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS).

I am therefore deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop any FOSS projects or continue to host my personal website.

I am currently actively considering how to move away from GitHub in the long term.

I urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) in order to better
understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of here within code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without
my permission, and I do not consent whatsoever to GitHub's use of it within Copilot.
